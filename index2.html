<h3>About Sanskriti</h3>
<br>
<h1><p><i>Committed To Excellence in Education.</i></p></h1>
<br>
<br>
<h3><p>Sanskriti school strives to enhance a child’s physical, social, emotional, and intellectual development in the most
crucial years of their child’s growth. We encourage children to inculcate a positive attitude towards learning, which
will hold them in good stead throughout life. To meet this goal, it is essential to help children set realistic goals
and undertake challenges in school that would hone their skills.</p></h4>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h1>WHAT WE ARE</h1>
<br>
<h3<p>Sanskriti school’s distinct tradition, culture of innovation and indomitable school spirit, provides a fertile learning
field for the New Age Child. Sanskriti school is an inclusive school where we have students of varying abilities with
personalised attention. The teacher’s role is more to inspire than to teach – to be a facilitator, role model and a
guide.


Creating a quality learning environment involves everyone – parents, students, teachers, support staff and volunteers,
each bringing a unique perspective and contribution towards fulfilling the school’s philosophy. They are essential
ingredients of our school’s continuing success.</p></h4>
